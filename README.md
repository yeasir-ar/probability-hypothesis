### 1. Simulate a Discrete Probability Distribution
a. Write Python code to simulate a discrete random variable representing a die
roll (numbers 1 through 6).    
b. Generate 10,000 random rolls of a fair die using NumPy.  
c. Plot the probability mass function (PMF) using a bar plot.
### 2. Binomial Distribution 
Suppose that an examination consists of six true and false questions and assume
that a student has no knowledge of the subject matter. The probability that the
student will guess the correct answer to the first question is 30%. Likewise, the
probability of guessing each of the remaining questions correctly is also 30%.  
a. What is the probability of getting exactly three correct answers?  
b. What is the probability of getting at least two correct answers?  
c. What is the probability of getting at most two correct answers?  
d. What is the probability of getting less than five correct answers?  
### 3. Poision Distribution
In a study of drug-induced anaphylaxis among patients taking rocuronium bromide
as part of their anesthesia, the occurrence of anaphylaxis followed a Poisson
distribution with λ =12 incidents per year in Norway. Find the probability that in the
next year, among patients receiving rocuronium.  
a. Exactly three will experience anaphylaxis.  
b. At least two will experience anaphylaxis  
c. At most two-experience anaphylaxis  
### 4. Normal Distribution
Suppose mean height of 500 students is 160 cm and SD is 5 cm. If height follows
normal distribution, then calculate the following:
Note: to get z-score table value you can use: norm.cdf() method. To do so, just
import as – “from scipy.stats import norm”  
a. What is the chance of height above 168 cm?  
b. What percentage of students will have height above 168 cm?  
c. How many of students will have height between 150 cm to 175cm?  
### 5. Prepare a document on how to calculate p-value to test hypotheses.
